# DiamondPricePrediction

This study investigates the efficacy of supervised machine learning techniques in predicting diamond prices. Employed various models, including linear regression, exponential
regression, and LSTM neural networks, on a robust dataset encompassing key diamond characteristics. Performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, RMSE, and MAE. The findings demonstrate the potential of these techniques to enhance pricing accuracy within the diamond industry, offering valuable insights into data-driven decisionmaking in this sector.
